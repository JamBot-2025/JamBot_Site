                    JamBot was originally conceived for participation in the Oregon Innovation Challenge. Through this program I received valuable mentorship and secured $5,000 in seed funding, which provided both the resources and the confidence to expand on my vision. What began as a concept quickly evolved into a functioning prototype: an AI-assisted music companion that generates real-time accompaniment tailored to a musicianâ€™s input.
